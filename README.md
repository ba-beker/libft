# Libft
The "Libft" project is a library of custom C functions created as part of the 42 school curriculum. It serves as a fundamental toolkit, providing essential functions for string manipulation, memory management, and various other common tasks.


## How It's Made:

The Libft project is implemented in C programming language and aims to provide a comprehensive collection of reusable functions. It covers various areas of programming, including string manipulation, memory allocation, linked lists, character handling, and more.

The library is built from scratch, without relying on any existing C library functions. This ensures a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and helps strengthen programming skills. Each function in the library is implemented to adhere to the standard C library conventions and specifications.

The codebase is organized into different modules, with each module containing related functions. This modular approach makes it easy to navigate, maintain, and extend the library. Additionally, the code is thoroughly documented, providing clear explanations of each function's purpose, input, output, and usage.

## Optimizations

While developing the Libft project, I focused on optimizing the efficiency and performance of the functions. Some of the optimizations I implemented include:

Algorithmic efficiency: I analyzed and optimized the algorithms used in various functions to ensure optimal time complexity. This involved using efficient data structures and employing techniques such as memoization and dynamic programming.

Memory management: I implemented memory management techniques to minimize memory leaks and efficiently allocate and deallocate memory. This optimization ensured effective resource utilization and prevented memory-related issues.

Error handling: I incorporated robust error handling mechanisms in the functions to provide informative feedback and prevent unexpected program behavior. This optimization improves the reliability and stability of the library.

These optimizations contribute to the overall efficiency and usability of the Libft library, making it a reliable and performant toolkit for various programming tasks.

## Lessons Learned:

Developing the Libft project provided valuable learning experiences and helped enhance my programming skills. Here are some of the key lessons I learned:

Deep understanding of fundamental concepts: Building a library of custom functions required a deep understanding of fundamental programming concepts. This project allowed me to strengthen my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, memory management, and other core concepts.

Code organization and documentation: Developing a comprehensive library reinforced the importance of well-organized code and thorough documentation. I learned how to structure code in a modular manner, write clear and concise documentation, and create reusable and maintainable code.

Error handling and debugging: The project emphasized the significance of robust error handling and effective debugging techniques. I gained experience in identifying and resolving issues, using debugging tools, and writing resilient code that handles various edge cases.

Software development best practices: Through the development of Libft, I learned and applied software development best practices, such as code reusability, code readability, and adherence to coding standards. These practices contribute to producing high-quality and maintainable code.
